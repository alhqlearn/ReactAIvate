## Overview
In this work, we demonstrate how reward shaping can render a policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL) approach a valuable tool for reaction discovery. Whereas we deploy RL to navigate the generation of novel practical molecules towards higher yield/selectivity regions, yield due to the newly generated molecules is predicted using a transfer learning model.

### Environmental Setup

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ReactAIvate
conda install -c dglteam/label/cu113 dgl # Make sure to match the CUDA version with your system
pip install dgllife
pip install rdkit
pip install scikit-learn
```
2. To train the ReactAIvate model use 'ReactAIvate.ipynb' file.
3. For CRM generation, use 'CRM_Generation_using_ReactAIvate.ipynb' python file.
